CRA project written with class components :)

## Learnt skills:
- Relative file paths for images doesn't work with create-react-app. To resolve this, import the image, and pass them as a variable in `src`
- Conditional rendering - to render a component by making it stateful (e.g., make a state that determines if button is clicked, if true, render component)
- `this.state.whatever` remembers previous state - assign it to a new variable for it to 'refresh'
