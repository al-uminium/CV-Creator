CRA project written with class components :)

## Learning points:
- Relative file paths for images doesn't work with create-react-app. To resolve this, import the image, and pass them as a variable in `src`
- Conditional rendering - to render a component by making it stateful (e.g., make a state that determines if button is clicked, if true, render component)
- `this.state.whatever` remembers previous state - assign it to a new variable for it to 'refresh' 
- CSS selectors doesn't work with inline styling. This can be rectified using `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events
- Changing parent state from a child component by passing the method from the parent
- Changing child state from parent by passing method from parent
- ### Changing Parent's State from Child
- Write a method that updates state in parent, and pass the method to child.
